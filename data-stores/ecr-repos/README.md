# Create EC2 Container Registry Repos

This Terraform Module creates an [EC2 Container Registry
(ECR)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html) Repo, which is where Docker images
can be uploaded. Note that ECR is an alternative to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If you don't have access to
this repo, email [support@gruntwork.io](mailto:support@gruntwork.io).

## How do you use this module?

See the [root README](/README.md) for instructions on using modules.
